### About `complain`

Why people always complain instead to find a solution to solve the problem. If you complain something, that means you can not solve it, and you will give up to solve it. So the problem is continue existing and you are stucked, can not jump over it and then your stop growing.

What my suggestion is stop tell you why you can not solve it, change the `complain` to the `question` :<font color="red">" _**how to solve it?**_"</font> This is mindset change, from `what` to `why`. It will drive you to find a solution. Either jump over, or pass by, it will not block you move forward.
